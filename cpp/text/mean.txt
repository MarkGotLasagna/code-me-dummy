/*  PROBLEM
    write a simple program that calculates the arithmetic mean of inputted scores 
    (max score: 30, base: 110) and halts when -1 is inserted
*/

/*  HINT
    a while() cycle could be the solution on storing inside a variable (say 'sum')
    the inputs as they come from std::cin
    the breaking condition for the while() loop will be -1
*/

/*  ALTERNATIVE to mean.cpp
    this assumes you already know how many inputs there will be
